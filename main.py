The application will query the Konnektive CRM API with the provided credentials and date range, and print the retrieved orders to the console.

## Notes

- Make sure to replace the `loginId` and `password` values in the `konnektive_api.py` file with your actual API credentials.
- The `query_orders` function in the `konnektive_api.py` file can be used as a helper function to query orders from the Konnektive CRM API.
- Feel free to modify the code to suit your specific requirements.
